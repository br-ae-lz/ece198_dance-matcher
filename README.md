I'll do a full reflection on this project later, as I think it's long overdue.

For now, I'll state that most of the code in this repo was provided to us as a skeleton to get things building on the STM32 platform and show us how to interface with pins and such. This is why a lot of the comments are very clearly not written by me.

This project had a pretty complex hardware rig (for what I've worked on so far, anyway), so it's difficult to understand exactly what it was without seeing that setup. Fortunately, I was prompted to create a quick video showcasing it in action before tearing it all to shreds.
